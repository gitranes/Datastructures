# Datastructures
Datastructures and algorithms solo project.

The assigment was to provide a "back-end" for a graph drawing program. Every method had to have a time complexity approximation and
the purpose was to seek the fastest possible implementations. Almost all of the code is C++'s STL. The usual graph searching 
algorithms eg. Djikstra, BFS, DFS, MST are part of the class. I received full marks from this project and the assistant praised my
implementation as the best he had reviewed.
